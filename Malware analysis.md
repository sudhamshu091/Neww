Automated malware detection in Android apps often utilizes static analysis, dynamic analysis, and machine learning (ML) techniques. Static analysis examines an app's code without running it, looking for suspicious patterns, while dynamic analysis observes the app's behavior during runtime. ML models, trained on large datasets of known malware and benign apps, can learn to identify patterns indicative of malicious activity. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of common tools and approaches:
1. Static Analysis:
Tools:
APK analysis tools: These tools unpack and analyze Android apps, revealing code, permissions, and other attributes. 
Static code analysis tools: These tools scan the app's code for common security vulnerabilities and suspicious patterns. 
API call analysis: Analyzing the API calls made by an app can help identify potentially malicious activities, according to research from MDPI. 
Techniques:
Signature-based detection: Identifying malware based on unique patterns or signatures found in the app's code. 
Permission-based detection: Analyzing the permissions requested by an app to identify potential threats. 
String analysis: Identifying suspicious strings or keywords within the app's code. 
2. Dynamic Analysis:
Tools:
Sandboxes: Controlled environments where apps can be run without affecting the user's device, allowing for observation of their behavior. 
Emulators: Platforms that simulate the Android operating system, enabling dynamic analysis of apps without needing a physical device. 
Techniques:
Behavioral analysis: Monitoring an app's runtime behavior, such as network connections, system calls, and file system access. 
Interactive behavior analysis: Manually interacting with an app in a sandbox to observe its responses and uncover hidden behaviors. 
3. Machine Learning:
Tools:
Machine learning frameworks: Platforms and libraries used to train and deploy ML models for malware detection. 
Online analyzers: Services that use ML models to scan apps for malware. 
Techniques:
Classification algorithms: Using ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, K-means, KNN) to classify apps as benign or malicious based on extracted features. 
Ensemble learning: Combining multiple ML models to improve detection accuracy. 
Deep learning: Employing deep neural networks to learn complex patterns from large datasets of app data. 
4. Hybrid Analysis:
Combining static and dynamic analysis: Utilizing both techniques for a more comprehensive analysis of Android apps. 
Leveraging ML models trained on both static and dynamic features: This approach allows for more accurate malware detection.
