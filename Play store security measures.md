 No, only for play store, not app store


Below is a focused overview of the security measures implemented by the Google Play Store and the reverse engineering methods used to analyze or bypass protections for Android apps, based on available information.

Security Measures Implemented by Google Play Store
The Google Play Store employs a combination of automated and manual reviews, developer verification, and runtime protections to secure its ecosystem. Key measures include:

App Review and Screening:
Every app and update undergoes automated screening for harmful behavior, with manual reviews for specific cases. Google’s policies aim to detect malware, phishing, or apps violating content guidelines.
Policies prohibit self-updating apps outside the Play Store’s mechanism or downloading executable code from external sources, though these can be bypassed using dynamic code loading.
Developer Verification:
Since August 31, 2023, new developer accounts must provide a valid D-U-N-S number, increasing accountability and reducing anonymous malicious submissions.
App listings include enhanced “App Support” sections with developer details (e.g., company name, address, website, phone number) for transparency.
Play Integrity API:
This API verifies if an app was installed from the Play Store and if the device is secure (e.g., not rooted). On Android 13+, it uses hardware-backed security signals for stronger, privacy-friendly checks.
Apps can display a “remediation dialog” to guide users to install from the Play Store if sideloaded, ensuring controlled distribution.
SafetyNet Attestation:
SafetyNet detects rooted devices or tampered system files, allowing developers to ensure apps run in secure environments.
It provides device integrity checks to prevent apps from running on compromised devices.
Code Obfuscation and Protection:
Google encourages developers to use tools like ProGuard or DexGuard to obfuscate code, making reverse engineering more difficult by scrambling method names, classes, and logic.
APKs are not encrypted by default, but developers can implement custom encryption or runtime checks.
Malware Detection and Removal:
Google uses automated tools to scan for malware, but reactive detection has been criticized, with external researchers often identifying threats like SharkBot, which evades scrutiny by releasing limited-function versions initially.
Malicious apps are removed upon detection, and developers may be banned, though proactive monitoring is less robust compared to some competitors.
Data Security and Privacy:
Developers must provide valid privacy policies, compliant with regulations like GDPR. However, studies indicate issues with missing or invalid policy links in some app categories.
Tools like DataStore are recommended for secure storage to prevent sensitive data (e.g., credentials) from being stored client-side in plain text.
Google Play Protect:
A built-in security feature on Android devices that scans apps for malicious behavior, even after installation, and can disable or remove harmful apps.
It provides real-time protection but may miss sophisticated threats that evade initial scans.
Reverse Engineering Methods for Google Play Store Apps
Reverse engineering involves analyzing an Android app’s code, structure, and behavior to understand its functionality, identify vulnerabilities, or bypass security measures. Below are common methods used for apps from the Google Play Store, along with their implications.

General Reverse Engineering Process
Obtaining the APK:
Download the Android Package Kit (APK) directly from the Play Store, extract it from a device using tools like ADB, or source it from third-party repositories (e.g., APKMirror).
APKs are not encrypted by default, making them accessible for analysis.
Decompiling and Disassembling:
Convert the APK’s Dalvik Executable (.dex) files into readable Java or Smali code using decompilers or disassemblers.
Analyze the code to understand app logic, extract sensitive data, or modify behavior.
Dynamic Analysis:
Run the app in an emulator (e.g., Android Studio Emulator, Genymotion) or on a rooted device to monitor runtime behavior, intercept function calls, or analyze network traffic.
Tools for Reverse Engineering
APKTool: Decompiles APKs to extract resources, AndroidManifest.xml, and Smali code, enabling modification and recompilation.
JADX: Converts .dex files to readable Java source code, revealing app logic, hardcoded keys, or API endpoints.
Frida: A dynamic instrumentation framework that injects JavaScript to manipulate running apps, bypass security checks, or intercept network traffic.
HoseDex2Jar: Converts .dex files to Java .jar files for analysis in Java decompilers, though it struggles with heavily obfuscated code.
Smali/Baksmali: Disassembles and reassembles Dalvik bytecode, allowing low-level modifications to app behavior.
MobSF (Mobile Security Framework): An automated tool for static and dynamic analysis, identifying vulnerabilities like insecure data storage or weak encryption.
Burp Suite: Intercepts and analyzes network traffic to uncover server-side vulnerabilities or bypass certificate pinning.
Specific Reverse Engineering Techniques
Bypassing Code Obfuscation:
Tools like ProGuard or DexGuard obfuscate code by renaming methods, classes, and variables. Reverse engineers use deobfuscators or manual analysis with JADX to reconstruct readable code.
String encryption (used to hide API keys or URLs) can be decrypted by identifying decryption routines in the code or dumping memory during runtime with Frida.
Extracting Sensitive Data:
Hardcoded API keys, tokens, or backend URLs can be extracted by analyzing decompiled code or running the strings command on the APK.
Insecure storage (e.g., credentials in SharedPreferences or plain-text files) can be accessed by inspecting the app’s data directory on a rooted device.
Bypassing Security Checks:
Root Detection: Apps may use SafetyNet or custom checks to detect rooted devices. These can be bypassed by modifying Smali code to stub out detection functions or using Frida to hook and alter the check’s return value.
Play Integrity API: Frida scripts or Magisk modules (e.g., Universal SafetyNet Fix) can spoof Play Integrity verdicts, tricking apps into believing they’re running on a secure device.
Certificate Pinning: Apps implementing certificate pinning to secure network requests can be bypassed by using Frida to disable pinning logic or by patching the APK to remove pinning checks.
Dynamic Code Loading:
Malicious apps may use dynamic code loading to download and execute code at runtime, evading Play Store scans. Reverse engineers can monitor network traffic with Burp Suite or Wireshark to identify and analyze downloaded code.
Tools like Frida can hook into dynamic loading functions (e.g., DexClassLoader) to dump loaded classes for analysis.
Modifying App Behavior:
Decompile the APK with APKTool, modify Smali or resource files (e.g., to bypass in-app purchase checks or alter UI elements), and recompile it into a new APK.
Sign the modified APK with a custom key using apksigner to install it on a device, though Play Integrity checks may block it unless bypassed.
Analyzing Play Store Algorithms:
Reverse engineering the Play Store’s search and ranking algorithms involves analyzing app metadata and user behavior. Tools like Atlas map apps and keywords using machine-learning models to reveal relevancy scores and user intent matching, aiding optimization or exploitation of store visibility.
Challenges in Reverse Engineering
Obfuscation: Advanced obfuscation with DexGuard or R8 can make decompiled code nearly unreadable, requiring significant manual effort or specialized deobfuscation tools.
Anti-Tampering: Some apps implement runtime checks to detect modifications, crashing or refusing to run if tampered. These can be bypassed with Frida or by patching the relevant checks.
Dynamic Analysis Detection: Apps may detect emulators or debuggers, requiring reverse engineers to use stealthy tools or rooted devices to avoid detection.
Legal and Ethical Considerations
Legality: Reverse engineering for security research or interoperability is often permitted under laws like the DMCA’s Section 1201 exemptions, but bypassing security measures for malicious purposes (e.g., piracy, malware creation) is illegal in many jurisdictions.
Ethics: Ethical reverse engineering improves app security by identifying vulnerabilities, but unauthorized analysis or distribution of modified APKs violates Google’s policies and can harm developers.
Google’s Response: Google may ban developer accounts or remove apps involved in reverse engineering violations, and modified APKs may be flagged by Play Protect.
