What are common signs of malicious behavior in a Play Store app?
ChatGPT said:
Malicious behavior in Play Store apps can be subtle or overt. Here are common signs that may indicate malicious or suspicious behavior:

1. Excessive Permissions
Requests permissions unrelated to the appâ€™s functionality (e.g., a flashlight app asking for contact, SMS, or microphone access).

Requests READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, or BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE without clear justification.

2. Obfuscated or Packed Code
Heavy use of obfuscation (ProGuard or custom techniques).

Use of packers like Bangcle, SecNeo, or Jiagu, especially in non-commercial apps.

Dynamic class loading or reflection to hide intent.

3. Background Services Abuse
Runs unnecessary background services even when the app is closed.

Uses foreground services persistently with no visible notification.

4. Data Exfiltration
Sends user data (contacts, location, device info) to unknown servers.

Uses covert channels (e.g., DNS tunneling or hidden steganographic techniques).

5. Click Fraud or Ad Fraud
Continuously loads ads in the background or clicks them automatically.

Uses overlays or invisible WebViews.

6. Overlay Attacks
Requests SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW or uses draw over other apps permission to capture input or steal credentials.

7. Phishing or Credential Harvesting
Mimics login screens of popular apps.

Requests users to enter sensitive information without using OAuth or verified login flows.

8. Root Detection or Anti-Analysis
Detects if the device is rooted, emulated, or if tools like Frida/Xposed are present.

Tries to evade dynamic analysis by delaying behavior or environment checks.

9. In-app Purchase Exploitation
Offers free features after background SMS or subscription triggering.

Abuses Play Billing APIs for fake transactions.

10. Fake Reviews or High Download-to-Review Ratio
Many 5-star reviews in broken English.

Repeated or similar comments across reviews.
