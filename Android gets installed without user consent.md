what is it called if android app gets installed without user consent.


It's called "sideloading" or "unauthorized app installation" when an Android app is installed without user consent. This often happens through:

Malware: Malicious apps or scripts exploit vulnerabilities to install apps.
Pre-installed bloatware: Apps installed by manufacturers or carriers without user choice.
Drive-by downloads: Apps installed via deceptive links or compromised websites.
Third-party app stores: Apps from unverified sources bypassing Google Play protections.
If this occurs, it may indicate a security breach or compromised device. Check for unfamiliar apps in Settings > Apps and scan with antivirus software.







Is it called the process manager?


No, the term "process manager" does not refer to the unauthorized installation of Android apps without user consent. A process manager is typically a system component or app that manages running processes, tasks, or resources on a device, such as controlling CPU usage or terminating background apps.

The correct term for apps being installed without user consent is "sideloading" (if done through unofficial sources) or "unauthorized app installation", often linked to malware, exploits, or pre-installed bloatware, as mentioned earlier. If you meant something specific by "process manager" in this context, could you clarify?







How does it gets installed, what is the process.


Unauthorized Android app installation (without user consent) typically occurs through exploitative or deceptive processes. Here’s how it happens and the general process involved:

1. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities
How: Hackers exploit security flaws in the Android OS, apps, or firmware.
Process:
A malicious app, link, or file (e.g., APK from a phishing email or website) is delivered to the device.
The exploit bypasses Android’s security mechanisms (e.g., permission checks or Play Protect).
The payload silently installs the app by leveraging root access or system-level vulnerabilities.
Example: Malware like Joker or Stagefright exploits use this method.
2. Sideloading via Third-Party Sources
How: Apps from unverified sources (outside Google Play) are installed without clear user approval.
Process:
User unknowingly enables "Install from Unknown Sources" (manually or tricked by a malicious app).
A compromised website, fake app store, or malicious ad triggers an APK download.
The APK installs automatically or with minimal user interaction (e.g., disguised as a system update).
Example: Clicking a malicious ad on a shady website downloads and installs an APK.
3. Pre-installed Bloatware or Carrier/Manufacturer Apps
How: Device manufacturers or carriers pre-install apps without user choice.
Process:
Apps are embedded in the device’s firmware or system partition during manufacturing.
These apps are installed automatically when the device boots up for the first time.
Users often cannot uninstall them without rooting the device.
Example: Carrier-branded apps or adware on budget Android devices.
4. Drive-by Downloads
How: Malicious websites or ads install apps without user interaction.
Process:
User visits a compromised or malicious website via a browser or app.
The site exploits browser vulnerabilities or uses social engineering (e.g., fake “update required” pop-ups).
An APK is downloaded and installed in the background, often without prompting.
Example: Rogue ads in free apps or pirated content sites.
5. Malicious Apps with Admin Privileges
How: A seemingly legitimate app gains excessive permissions and installs other apps.
Process:
User installs a malicious app from Google Play or a third-party source.
The app requests device admin or accessibility service permissions.
It uses these privileges to download and install additional apps without user consent.
Example: Fake flashlight or cleaner apps that install adware.
Technical Process (General Steps for Installation)
Regardless of the method, the installation process typically involves:

APK Delivery: A malicious APK (Android Package file) is downloaded to the device.
Permission Bypass: The attacker bypasses or manipulates Android’s permission system (e.g., exploiting "Unknown Sources" or system vulnerabilities).
Installation Trigger: The APK is executed, either automatically (via exploits) or through deceptive prompts (e.g., disguised as a system update).
Post-Installation: The app may hide its icon, run in the background, or request additional permissions to persist on the device.
Why It Happens
Android’s Open Nature: Android allows sideloading and third-party app stores, unlike iOS, making it easier for malicious apps to infiltrate.
User Behavior: Clicking unverified links, downloading APKs, or granting excessive permissions enables these installations.
Outdated Software: Unpatched devices are vulnerable to known exploits.
Prevention
Keep “Install from Unknown Sources” disabled.
Update your device and apps regularly.
Avoid unverified websites, APKs, or third-party app stores.
Use antivirus apps (e.g., Malwarebytes, Avast) to scan for threats.
Check Settings > Apps for unfamiliar apps and revoke suspicious permissions.
If you suspect unauthorized installations, boot into Safe Mode to disable third-party apps and uninstall the culprit, or perform a factory reset if necessary. Let me know if you need steps for these!
