Hi, I’m a cybersecurity professional with 2.2 years of experience in web and mobile application security, manual secure code reviews, Static Application Security Testing (SAST), vulnerability assessments, and software composition analysis (SCA). I’m familiar with the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and have working knowledge of Java and JavaScript. I use GitHub repositories for code management and have experience identifying fix commits for CVEs in GitHub source repositories. I leverage SCA tools like dependency check to manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and use tools like phpMyAdmin to streamline tasks. By incorporating AI, I enhance my efficiency and strengthen my security strategies. Passionate about secure application development, I stay updated with industry trends to deliver reliable solutions.
