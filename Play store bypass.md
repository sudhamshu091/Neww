Malicious developers employ several tactics to bypass Google Play Store review mechanisms. These include versioning (introducing malicious payloads through updates), dynamic code loading (loading malicious code from external servers), and masquerading as benign apps. They also use techniques like hiding malicious code, disabling launcher activities, and abusing Android features like the Leanback Launcher to evade detection. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of these tactics:
Versioning:
A developer might release a legitimate app that passes initial review, then later push updates from their own servers that introduce malicious code, BleepingComputer says. 
Dynamic Code Loading:
Developers can load malicious code from external servers after the app has been installed, essentially circumventing the static analysis that Google Play Store performs, BleepingComputer explains. 
Masquerading:
Apps are often labeled as beta or early versions to avoid thorough code review, Security Info Watch says. 
Hiding Malicious Code:
Developers might use obfuscation and other techniques to make it difficult for Google Play's security systems to identify malicious code within the app, Google Cloud explains. 
Abusing Features:
Some malicious apps abuse features like the Android Leanback Launcher or hide in Settings to avoid user detection and removal, Infosecurity Magazine reports. 
Disabling Launcher Activities:
Some apps are downloaded with the Launcher Activity disabled, and then use native code to enable it after installation, which can also help them evade detection,
