Threat Modeling for Android 


Threat modeling for Android involves identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential security threats to an Android application or system to mitigate risks effectively. Below is a structured approach to threat modeling for Android, tailored to the platform’s unique architecture, security features, and common attack vectors.

1. Define the Scope and Goals
Objective: Determine what you’re protecting (e.g., user data, app integrity, device security).
Assets:
Sensitive data (e.g., credentials, PII, encryption keys).
App functionality (e.g., payment processing, authentication).
Device resources (e.g., camera, storage, network).
System Boundaries:
App components (Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, Content Providers).
External interactions (APIs, cloud services, third-party libraries).
Android OS features (permissions, intents, sandboxing).
Example: For a banking app, assets include user credentials, transaction data, and secure communication with the backend.

2. Decompose the System
Break down the Android app or system to understand its components and data flows:

App Architecture:
Frontend: UI components (Activities, Fragments).
Backend: Local storage (SQLite, SharedPreferences), network calls (HTTP/HTTPS).
Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Intents, Content Providers, or Binders.
Data Flows:
How data moves between app components, device, and external services.
Identify entry points (e.g., user inputs, network requests, intent receivers).
Trust Boundaries:
App sandbox vs. other apps.
App vs. OS (e.g., permission requests).
App vs. external servers.
Tool: Use a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to map components, data flows, and trust boundaries.

Example: A DFD for a messaging app might show user input → encryption → network transmission → server, with trust boundaries at the app sandbox and network layer.

3. Identify Threats
Use a structured methodology like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to identify threats specific to Android.

STRIDE Category	Android-Specific Threats	Examples
Spoofing	Impersonating a user or app	Phishing via fake login screens, intent spoofing.
Tampering	Modifying code or data	APK reverse engineering, modifying SharedPreferences.
Repudiation	Denying actions	Lack of audit logs for transactions.
Information Disclosure	Leaking sensitive data	Unencrypted storage, exposed Content Providers.
Denial of Service	Disrupting app availability	Crashing app via malformed intents, battery drain attacks.
Elevation of Privilege	Gaining unauthorized access	Exploiting misconfigured permissions, privilege escalation via root exploits.
Common Android-Specific Threats:

Insecure Data Storage: Storing sensitive data in plain text (e.g., SharedPreferences, internal storage).
Insecure Communication: Unencrypted network traffic or weak TLS configurations.
Improper Permission Usage: Over-requesting permissions or exposing components (e.g., exported Activities).
Intent Hijacking: Malicious apps intercepting or sending intents.
Reverse Engineering: Decompiling APKs to extract keys or logic.
Malware and Root Exploits: Attacks leveraging rooted devices or malicious apps.
Side-Channel Attacks: Leaking data via logs, clipboard, or screenshots.
4. Analyze and Prioritize Threats
Evaluate threats based on risk, considering:

Likelihood: How feasible is the attack? (e.g., rooted device vs. standard device).
Impact: What’s the consequence? (e.g., data breach vs. app crash).
Attack Surface: Entry points like exported components, network APIs, or user inputs.
Risk Assessment Framework: Use DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability) to score threats.

Example:
Threat: Unencrypted storage of API keys.
DREAD Score: High Damage (data breach), High Reproducibility (easy to extract), Moderate Exploitability (requires app decompilation), High Affected Users (all users), High Discoverability (common attack).
Risk: High → Prioritize mitigation.
Android-Specific Considerations:

Device Fragmentation: Different Android versions and OEM modifications affect security (e.g., outdated devices lack modern APIs).
Rooted Devices: Assume some users have rooted devices, increasing risk of privilege escalation.
App Stores: Malware risks on third-party stores vs. Google Play.
5. Mitigate Threats
Implement countermeasures tailored to Android’s security model and best practices.
