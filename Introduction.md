Iâ€™m Sudhamshu, a Penetration Tester from Kasaragod with over two years of experience in VAPT, threat modeling, and SAST/DAST across web, mobile, and API platforms.

At Cyraacs, my previous employer, I led VAPT engagements, result driven, identifying over 100 vulnerabilities and optimizing SAST/DAST automation, improving scan efficiency. My efforts reduced critical security risks by 78% in banking and fintech sectors, including for clients like FIS Global. I partnered with development teams to strengthen CI/CD pipeline security and response times.

I am being positive and eager to join your organization, learn new things, grow and contribute to the team.
