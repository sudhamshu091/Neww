Thank you for considering me for this role. I am Sudhamshu, I am a Penetration Tester with over two years of specialized experience in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT), threat Modeling, static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST), for web, mobile, and API applications and some reverse engineering for Android applications. My expertise in tools like Burp Suite, Ghidra, MobSF, and Frida, combined with my experience in reading java code, Scripting with Python, has enabled me to reduce security risks by 78% in banking and fintech environments. For example one of my clients FIS global, who maintain a list of all reported vulnerabilities by different consulting firms. I have observed that after our reporting and validation of the vulnerabilities, the vulnerabilities are significantly reduced. Also At Cyraacs, I conducted comprehensive VAPT, identifying over 100 vulnerabilities, and automated some SAST/DAST applications and processes, boosting scan efficiency by 150% while integrating security into CI/CD pipelines and helping the developers to mitigate the issues. With a foundational skill in reverse engineering for Android and a proven track record in securing applications, I am eager to leverage my skills, I am eager to learn new things to enhance the security of Googleâ€™s AppStore and android ecosystem, ensuring robust protection against emerging threats.
