Thank you for considering me for this opportunity. I’m Sudhamshu, from Kasaragod. I am a Penetration Tester with over two years of hands-on experience in VAPT, threat modeling, and both static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) across web, mobile, and API platforms. I’ve also worked on Android reverse engineering using tools like Ghidra, Frida, and MobSF, alongside Java code analysis and Python scripting.

At Cyraacs, I led VAPT engagements that uncovered over 100 vulnerabilities and enhanced SAST/DAST automation, boosting scan efficiency by 150%. My work contributed to a 78% reduction in critical security risks in banking and fintech environments, including for clients like FIS Global. I collaborated closely with development teams to integrate security insights into their workflows, indirectly improving CI/CD pipeline resilience and response times.

With a strong foundation in Android reverse engineering and a passion for continuous learning, I’m excited to contribute to securing Google’s Play Store and Android ecosystem against evolving threats.
