Thank you for giving me this opportunity. Iâ€™m Sudhamshu, a Penetration Tester from Kasaragod, Kerala with over two years of experience in VAPT, Application Security, threat modeling, and SAST/DAST across web, mobile, and API platforms.

At Cyraacs, my previous employer, I led VAPT engagements, So my typical working day at Cyraacs would involve managed vapt engagements, that were result driven prioritising vulnerabilities based on security standards and impact, identifying 50-100+ vulnerabilities and also optimizing SAST/DAST automation and improving scan efficiency. My efforts reduced critical security risks by 78% in banking and fintech sectors, including for clients like FIS Global. I worked closely with development teams to strengthen  their SSDLC and CI/CD pipeline security and response times.

I am positive and eager to join your organization, learn new things, grow and contribute to the team.
